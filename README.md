<h1>WaveReact</h1>
WaveReact is a react based web app to draw digital waveforms using JSON like data structure. It's identical to wavedrom editor, which is absoulutely great, but lacks certain feature. WaveReact tries to overcome those lackings. 

Some additional features available in WaveReact are-
*More flexibility: you can change the color, line width of your waves, super essential when dealing with a crowd of signals. 
*Keep tracking: Signal names don't fly off when the waveforms are enormous. They tend to stick on one place, in front of you. Cause They love you!
*Patterns: Don't want to write counter values like 0,1,3.. ? you can add a counter string like ud(1,5) and it'll count from 1, five times incrementing 1 in decimal. You can specify the increment like ud(1,5,3). Now it's 1 4 7 10 13. Want it in Hex? use ux. Same parameters. 
*Reapetiting waves: Have some common pattern in waves? add them like ('pattern', repetition). No string concatenation or anything. 
*Auto-formatting: Well, try it out. You'll like it. It alings the key parameters vertically so they look nice (aesthetic, dude!).
*Tabs: Tabs are essesntial. You can now have all the signals of a project in one single window, one file. Neat.
*Dark mode: A treat for your eyes. You're welcome.
